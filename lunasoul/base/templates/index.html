    <h2>About Us</h2>
   <p>We are Korea's next hot hot hot girl group, LUNA SOUL. Our journey began when we auditioned for the TV talent contest Superstar-K.<p/>
    <p>It was so nerve wracking sitting back stage hearing everyone with such awesome voices. As the competition went on we got to know each other and really support each others journey.</p>
    <p>When the judges suggest we get put in a group it was like obviously, why didn't we think of that. It was just the natural thing to do.</p>
    <p>We are like best friends now and it's so much fun getting to travel the world together and do what we love. Come see us on tour, and tweet us which city we should visit next!</p>
    <p>XOXO LUNA SOUL</p>
